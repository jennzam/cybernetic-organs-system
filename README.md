# cybernetic-organs-system
A futuristic company specializing in creating bio-compatible cybernetic organs for human augmentation and replacement. This project will require a deep understanding of object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms to simulate the complex interactions between biological and mechanical components.

Project Name: [Cybernetic Organs System]

Details:

This project will utilize classes and methods in order to create a functional program that uses OOP.

The CyberneticOrgan class declares the class attributes for the organs and implements two methods (getDetails() & isCompatible()) in which the first method 
mentioned will be used to return organ details and the second method will be utilized to verify organ compatibility.

The Patient class declares class attributes related to the patient. It also implements a addOrgan() method that adds an organ to a patient's existing 
organ list. The final method, getPatientInfo(), focuses on retreiving and returning a patient's details. 

The OrganInventory class will the used to store organs in an array/placeholder list. This class will also use the addOrgan() method to add new organs to the 
inventory, and the getOrgan() method will provide a way to retrieve an organ by its model from the inventory.
